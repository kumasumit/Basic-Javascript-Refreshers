    <h1>Closures ...</h1>
    <p>
      An inner function bundled with lexical scope of its outer/parent function
      is called Closure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closures are used in memo, once, currying, data hiding and encapsulation,
      setting private variables in javascript, using getters and setters in
      Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
      the major disadvantage of closures is excess memory space, the closed
      variales are not garbage collected and consume space in the memory.
